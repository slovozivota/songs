[V1]
 When the music fades, all is stripped away,
 And I simply come,
 Longing just to bring something that's of worth
 That will bless Your heart.

[V2]
 I'll bring You more than a song,
 For a song itself
 Is not what You have required.
 You search much deeper within
 Through the way things appear;
 You're looking into my heart.


[C]
 I'm coming back to the heart of worship,
 And it's all about You,
 All about You, Jesus.
 I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it.
 When it's all about You,
 All about You, Jesus.

[V3]
 King of endless worth, no one could express
 How much You deserve.
 Though I'm weak and poor, all I have is Yours,
 Every single breath.
 I'll bring You more than a song...
