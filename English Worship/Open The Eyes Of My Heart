.E                                B
 Open the eyes of my heart, Lord, open the eyes of my heart,
.          A                  E
 I want to see You, I want to see You. (2x)

[C]
.           B               C#m
 To see You high and lifted up,
.A                            B
 Shining in the light of Your glory;
.B                       C#m
 Pour out Your power and love,
.           A           B     E
 As we sing holy, holy, holy.

[B]
.E
 Holy, holy, holy...
.B
 Holy, holy, holy...
.A
 Holy, holy, holy...
.          E
 I want to see You.</lyrics></song>
