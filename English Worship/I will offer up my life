[V1]
 I will offer up my life
 in spirit and truth,
 pouring out the oil of love
 as my worship to You.
 In surrender I must give
 my every part;
 Lord, receive the sacrifice
 of a broken heart.

[C1]
 Jesus, what can I give,
 what can I bring
 to so faithful a friend,
 to so loving a King?
 Saviour, what can be said,
 what can be sung

[C2]
 as a praise of Your name
 for the things You have done?
 Oh, my words could not tell,
 not even in part,
 of the debt of love that is owed
 by this thankful heart.

[V2]
 You deserve my every breath
 for YouÂ´ve paid the great cost;
 giving up Your life to death,
 even death on a cross
 You took all my shame away,
 there defeated my sin
 opened up the gates of heaven,
 and have beckoned me in.</lyrics></song>
