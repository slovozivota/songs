  <lyrics>[V1]
.G       D/F#    Em   Em/D            Bm         Em
 Lord, I come to You, let my heart be changed, renewed,
.D                C             D        Em  D
 Flowing from the grace, That I found in You;
.G          D/F#    Em        Em/D         Bm     Em
 Lord, I've come to know, the weaknesses I see in me,
.D                 C   D                     G    G7
 Will be stripped away, By the power of Your love.

[C]
.   C    Em D                       C
 So hold me close, Let Your love surround me;
.C     Em D                     G     G7
 Bring me near, Draw me to Your side;
.    C    D                           C G
 And as I wait, I'll rise up like the eagles,
.    D/F#             Em        D               C
 And I will soar with You, Your Spirit leads me on,
.       D             G
 In the power of Your love.

[V2]
.G      D/F#    Em                   Bm      Em
 Lord unveil my eyes, Let me see You face to face,
.    D                 C            D       Em D
 The knowledge of Your love, As You live in me;
.G      D/F#   Em                   Bm          Em
 Lord renew my mind, As Your will unfolds in my life,
.   D            C   D                     G    G7
 In living every day, In the power of Your love.</lyrics></song>
