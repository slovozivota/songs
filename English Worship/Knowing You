[V1]
 All I once held dear, built my life upon,
 All this world reveres, and wars to own,
 All I once thought gain I have counted loss;
 Spent and worthless now, compared to this.

[V2]
 Knowing You, Jesus, knowing You,
 There is no greater thing.
 You're my all, You're the best,
 You're my joy, my righteousness
 And I love You, Lord.

[V3]
 Now my heart desire is to know You more,
 to be found in You, and known as Yours,
 To possess by faith what I could not learn;
 All surpassing gift of righteousness.

[V4]
 Oh to know the power of Your risen life,
 And to know You in Your suffering,
 To become like You in Your death, my Lord;
 So with You to live, and never die.</lyrics></song>
