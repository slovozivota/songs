  <lyrics>[V1]
.C              Am7          G             F
 Hungry, I come to You for I know You satisfy,
.C           Am7             G                 F
 I am empty, but I know Your love does not run dry;
.       G          F/A       G/B      F
 And so I wait for You; so I wait for You…

[C]
.    C             F7
 I'm falling on my knees,
.  C             F7
 Offering all of me;
.  C                    F7              C
 Jesus, You're all this heart is living for.

[V2]
.C             Am7             G             F
 Broken, I run to You for Your arms are open wide,
.C           Am7             G                 F
 I am weary, but I know Your touch restores my life;
.         G        F/A       G/B      F
 And so I wait for You; so I wait for You…</lyrics></song>
