  <lyrics>[V1]
 All for love, a Father gave
 For only love could make a way
 All for love, the heavens cried for love was crucified

[B]
 Oh, how many times have I broken Your heart
 But still You forgive if only I ask
 And how many times have You heard me pray
 Draw near to me

[C]
 Everything I need is You
 My beginning, my forever
 Everything I need is You

[V2]
 Let me sing all for love
 I will join the angel song
 Ever holy is the Lord
 King of glory, King of all</lyrics></song>
