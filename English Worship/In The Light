[V]
.    A          B         C#m                      A        B         C#m
1    I keep     trying to find a life on my        own a____part from You;
2The disease of self runs through my blood, it's a cancer fatal to my soul;
.A        B             C#m                A                   B               C#m
1I am the king of ex____cuses; I've got    one for every       selfish thing I do.
2Every at_tempt on my behalf has failed to bring this sickness under con_______trol.

.A            B    C#m             A        B     C#m
 What's going on inside of me? I despise my own behavior;
.          A            B    C#m                    A              B         C#m
 This only serves to confirm my suspicions that I'm still a man in need of a Savior.

.        A         E         B              C#m            A              E            B 
 I wanna be in the Light,|as You are in the Light; I wanna shine like the stars in the Heavens
.   A           E          B        C#m
 Oh Lord, be my Light, and be my salvation,
.       A             B            C#m    A             B            C#m
 'Cause all i want is to be in the Light, All i want is to be in the Light</lyrics></song>
