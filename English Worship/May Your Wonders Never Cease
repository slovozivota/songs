1Father in Heaven,
2Beautiful Savior,
.              Am          G        C
1Lord may Your name be     glori____fied
2Truly we      praise Your Love for us.
.            Am     G               C
1Above all   others, above all this world,
2While we as sinners in all our     weakness
.              Am         G           C
1Above every___thing else in our      lives.||
2And still You gave Your  life on the cross.||

.    Dm                                   Am
1For nothing else in all of this world    matters
2You saved us, Lord, from all of our transgressions
.       C                               B7
1But to live our lives for You and You alone.
2And de_livered us into Your loving    arms.

.         Am
 May Your wonders never cease,
.         F
 May Your Spirit never leave,
.       C                     G
 May we ever long to see Your face;
.            Am
 And when we turn from You again
.       F
 Oh how quickly we forget,
.       C                   B7
 May we be reminded of Your grace:
.                       Am    G C
 May Your wonders never cease.</lyrics></song>
