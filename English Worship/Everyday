  <lyrics>[V1a]
 What to say Lord
 It's you who gave me life and I
 Can't explain just how
 Much You mean to me now that

[V1b]
 You have saved me Lord
 (I) give all that I am to You
 That everyday I could
 Be a light that shines Your name 

[V2a]
 Everyday Lord I'll
 Learn to stand upon Your Word
 And I pray that I
 might come to know You more

[V2b] 
 That you would guide me
 In every single step I take
 That everyday I can
 Be Your light unto the world

[C]
 Everyday
 It's you I'll live for
 Everyday, I'll follow after You
 Everyday, I'll walk with You my Lord

[B]
 It's You I live for everyday</lyrics></song>
