  <lyrics>[V1]
 Good and gracious
 Attributes of a loving father
 You’re high and mighty
 But humble all the same
 You have made the heavens and the earth
 And you made us in your image Lord
 
[V2]
 Holy, holy, holy is the Lord almighty and
 We rejoice in you alone for you are worthy and
 You have given life to me
 And I love to worship at your feet
 And I love to love you
 Just for who you are
 
[V3]
 Death and hell
 Are now no longer things I fear because
 You have saved me
 And I’m grateful to the core
 I’m your child because of Jesus’ blood
 And your spirit leads me guides me fills me
 
[V4]
 I’m so grateful for the things
 That you have given me
 Your love your grace
 Your joy your peace and more
 
[V5]
 Holy, holy
