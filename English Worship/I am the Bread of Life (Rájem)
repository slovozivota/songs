  <lyrics>[C]
 I am the bread of Life
 all who eat this bread will never die.
 I am God’s love revealed
 I am broken that you might be healed.

[V1]
 All who eat of this heavenly bread,
 all who drink this cup of the covenant
 you will live forever
 for I will raise you up.

[V2]
 No one who comes to me, shall hunger again,
 no one who believes shall ever thirst.
 All that the Father draws shall come to me
 and I shall give them rest.</lyrics></song>
