  <lyrics>[V1]
.    E(no3)                         A2       Bsus
 How lovely is Your dwelling place,|O Lord Almighty;
.E(no3)                            Bsus
 My soul longs and even faints for You.
.    E(no3)                     A2          Bsus
 For here my heart is satisfied|within Your presence;
.  E(no3)                          Bsus
 I sing beneath the shadow of Your wings.

[C]
.          A2
 Better is one day in Your courts,
.          Bsus
 Better is one day in Your house,
.          A2
 Better is one day in Your courts,
.               Bsus
 Than thousands elsewhere.

[V2]
.    E(no3)                       A2          Bsus
 One thing I ask, and would seek: To see Your beauty,
.   E(no3)                           Bsus
 To find You in the place Your glory dwells. (2x)

.C#m7                   B   A2                  Bsus
 My heart and flesh cry out for You, the living God,
.C#m7                B      A2   Bsus
 Your Spirit's water for my soul;
.C#m7                 B     A2                 Bsus
 I've tasted and I've seen, come once again to me,
.C#m                 Bsus A2                  F#m  Bsus
 I will draw near to You, I will draw near to You.</lyrics></song>
