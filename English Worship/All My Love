  <lyrics>[V1]
 Jesus Christ
 You came into this world to rescue me
 On the cross
 My sin was laid on you what agony
 There your precious lifeblood flowed so free
 Every drop that fell still cleanses me
 
[C]
 All your love
 All your love
 All your love
 Pouring out for me
 Like a flood
 
[V2]
 I am safe
 Upon the ocean of your mercy
 I am loved
 With all the passion of eternity
 It is deeper than the deepest sea
 Like a tidal wave it carries me
 
[V3]
 So I stand
 Upon your promise of eternal grace
 I believe
 That I will one day see you face to face
 I will worship you forevermore
 In ways I never have before
