  I see the king of glory
.  C#m
  Coming down the clouds with fire
.                  F#open                  B2
  The whole earth shakes, the whole earth shakes
  I see his love and mercy
  Washing over all our sin
  The people sing, the people sing

[V2]
  I see a generation
  Rising up to take the place
  With selfless faith, with selfless faith
  I see a new revival
  Staring as we pray and seek
  We're on our knees, we're on our knees

  Heal my heart and make it clean
.  E                      C#m
  Open up my eyes to the things unesen
.  A                        B              (C#m)
  Show me how to love like you have loved me
.  A                    B
  Break my heart for what is yours
.  E                        C#m
  Everything I am for your kingdom's cause
.  A                         B              (C#m)
  As I walk from earth into eternity
