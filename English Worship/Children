 When You said, blessed are the      poor did You      think of me right now?
                All I have is        worthless next to You

[V2]
 When You said, blessed are the merciful I cried, woe to me
 Help me see my brother like You do
 When You said, blessed are the pure I cried, God it's just too much!
 Make me pure, I just have to see You!
