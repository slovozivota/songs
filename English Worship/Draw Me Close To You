.A                D
 Draw me close to You,
.E            A
 Never let me go;
.E            D
 I lay it all down again,
.F#m                  Dmaj7          E
 To hear You say that I'm Your friend.

[2]
.A            D
 You are my desire,
.E                A
 No one else will do;
.E                         D
 `Cause nothing else could take Your place,
.F#m7                  Dmaj7       E
 To feel the warmth of Your embrace;
.A                E7sus E                A  D E
 Help me find the way,  bring me back to You.

[C]
.A      E     D
 You're all I want,
.A      E        D    E
 You're all Iâ€™ve ever needed;
.A      E     D
 You're all I want,
.E7sus        E       A
 Help me know You are near.</lyrics></song>
