  <lyrics>[V1]
.D              A                      Em                 A
 When the music fades, all is stripped away, and I simply come;
.D               A                         Em                          A
 Longing just to bring something that's of worth, that will bless Your heart.

[P]
.Em             D/F#        A                     Em
 I'll bring You more than a song, for a song in itself,
.            D/F#       A     A/C#
 Is not what You have required
.Em              D/F#       A                            Em
 You search much deeper within, through the way things appear,
.               D/F#    A
 You're looking into my heart.

[C]
.D                      A2/C#
 I'm coming back to the heart of worship,
.         Em                  G         A      D
 And it's all about You; it's all about You, Jesus;
.D                       A2/C#
 I'm sorry, Lord for the thing I've made it
.          Em                  G         A      D    A Em Asus A D
 When it's all about You; it's all about You, Jesus.

[V2]
.D               A                     Em                    A
 King of endless worth, no one could express, how much You deserve;
.D                   A                   Em                  A
 Though I'm weak and poor, all I have is Yours, every single breath.</lyrics></song>
