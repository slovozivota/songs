  <lyrics>[V1]
  You are God in Heaven
  And here am I on earth
  So I'll let my words be few
  Jesus I am so in love with you
[C]
  And I'll stand in awe of you
  Yes I'll stand in awe of you
  And I'll let my words be few
  Jesus I am so in love with you
[V2]
  The simplest of all love songs
  I long to bring to you
  So I'll let my words be few
  Jesus I am so in love with you</lyrics></song>
