  <lyrics>[V1]
 He has risen
 He has risen
 Jesus is alive
 
[V2]
 When the life flowed from His body
 Seemed like Jesus' mission failed
 But His sacrifice accomplished
 Vict'ry over sin and hell
 
[V3]
 In the grave God did not leave Him
 For His body to decay
 Raised to life - the Great Awakening
 Satan's power He overcame
 
[V4]
 If there were no resurrection
 We ourselves could not be raised
 But the son of God is living
 So our hope is not in vain
 
[V5]
 When the Lord rides out of heaven
 Mighty angels at His side
 They will sound the final trumpet
 From the grave we shall arise
 
[V6]
 He has given life immortal
 We shall see Him face to face
 Through eternity we'll praise Him
 Christ the champion of our faith
