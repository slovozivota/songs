  <lyrics>[V1]
 When the way ahead is not clear
 And inspiration’s not here
 When I’m in a dry and desert place
 And I wanna see you face to face
 
[V2]
 I don’t wanna worship from afar
 I don’t wanna follow foreign gods
 And if to worship is to kiss
 I won’t settle for any less than this
 
[V3]
 Could you look into my eyes tonight
 Could you purify my mind tonight
 Could you come and change my life tonight Jesus
 
[V4]
 When the word of life seems dead to me
 And I don’t feel like I’ve been set free
 When all around they sing of victory
 But it’s only darkness that I see
 
[V5]
 I don’t wanna worship from afar
 I don’t wanna follow foreign gods
 And if to worship is to kiss
 I won’t settle for any less than this
 
[V6]
 Could you look into my eyes tonight
 Could you purify my mind tonight
 Could you come and change my life tonight Jesus
 If I worship you because you are Lord
 Who sketched the heavens and created the world
 And called my name before the day I was born
 Jesus you are my Lord
