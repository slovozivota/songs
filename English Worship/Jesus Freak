.Em  C	       A                       Em              C          A
1Separated, I cut myself clean|From a past that comes back in my darkest of dreams;
2Kamikaze, my death is gain|I've been marked by my    Maker, a peculiar display;
.Em	       C           A                        Em             C              A
1Been appre___hended by a spiritual force,|And a   grace that re__placed all the me I divorced.
2The high and lofty, they see me as weak,|'Cause I won't live and die, for the   power they seek?

.            Em                         C                     A
1I saw a     man with a tat(too) on his big fat belly,|It     wiggled around like marmalade jelly.
2There was a man in the desert with     naps in his head,|The sand that he walked was also his bed.
.    Em                           C                            A
1It  took me a while to           catch what it said,|'Cause I had to match the rhythm of his belly with my head.||
2The words that he spoke made the people assume,|There         wasn't too much left in the upper room.||
.     Em                    C                      A
1     "Jesus Saves" is      what it raved,|In a    typical tatoo green.
2With scabs on his back and hair on his face,|They thought he was strange by the locust he ate.
.           Em                          C                          A
1He         stood on a box in the       middle of the city|And     claimed he had a dream.
2Ya see the Pharisees tripped when they heard him speak,|Until the king took the head of this Jesus Freak.

.Em               G               D               A     Bm
 What will people think when they hear that I'm a Jesus Freak?
.Em               G            D             A Bm
 What will people do when they find out it's true?
.Em             G            D          A     Bm
 I don't really care if they label me a Jesus Freak.
.Em                G           D    A Bm
 There ain't no disguising the truth.

 People say I'm strange, does that make me a stranger,|That my best friend was born in a manger. (2x)

.Em               G      D         A  Bm         Em               G   D         A  Bm
 What will people think (What will people think)|What will people do (What will people do)
.Em             G     D         A   Bm     Em                G           D            A  Bm  Em
 I don't really care (What else can I say)|There ain't no disguising the truth (Jesus is the way)</lyrics></song>
