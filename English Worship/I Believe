  <lyrics>[V1]
 I believe
 In everything you do
 All you have to say
 I’ve come to realise
 You’re the only way
 Oh I believe in you
 
[V2]
 I’ve received
 Something in my life
 Greater than before
 Your truth has set me free
 And I love you Lord
 Oh I believe in You
 
[V3]
 Let the angels sing
 Of the Lord’s great love
 Well it’s shining down
 Like the Heavens above
 Let the nations bow
 To the living God and know your truth
 I believe in You
