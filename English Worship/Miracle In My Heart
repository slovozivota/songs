  <lyrics>[V1]
 We are called to be 
 Prophets to this nation
 To be the word of God 
 In every situation
 Change my heart change my heart today
 Who’ll be the salt 
 If the salt should lose it’s flavour 
 Who’ll be the salt 
 If the salt should lose it’s flavour
 Change my heart change my heart today
 
[V2]
 Lord loose the chains of oppresion
 Lord set the captives free
 Lord fill my heart with compassion
 Shine your light
 Shine your light
 Shine your light through me
 
[V3]
 Work a miracle in my heart
 Work a miracle in my heart
 Work a miracle in my heart
 Today
 
[V4]
 Lord take all my lies 
 And take all of my greed
 Let me be a sacrifice 
 For those who are in need
 Change my heart change my heart today 
 Lord without your power 
 It’s all just good intentions
 Lord without your grace 
 Who could find redemption
 Change my heart change my heart today
