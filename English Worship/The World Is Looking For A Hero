  <lyrics>[V1]
 The world is looking for a hero
 We know the greatest one of all
 The mighty ruler of the nations
 King of kings and Lord of lords
 Who took the nature of a servant
 And gave His life to save us all
 
[V2]
 We will raise a shout
 We will shout it out
 He is the champion
 Of the world
 We will raise a shout
 We will shout it out
 He is the champion of the world
 
[V3]
 The Lord almighty is our hero
 He breaks the stranglehold of sin
 Through Jesus' love we fear no evil
 Powers of darkness flee from him
 His light will shine in every nation
 A sword of justice He will bring.
