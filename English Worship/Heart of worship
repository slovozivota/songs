  <lyrics>[V1]
  When the music fades 
  All is stripped away
  And I simply come
  Longing just to bring 
  Something that's of worth
  That will bless Your heart

[V2]
  I'll bring You more than a song
  For a song in itself 
  Is not what You have required
  You search much deeper within
  Through the way things appear
  You're looking into my heart

[V3]
  I'm coming back to the heart of worship
  And it's all about You  
  All about You Jesus
  I'm sorry Lord for the thing I've made it
  When it's all about You
  All about You Jesus

[V4]
  King of endless worth no one could express how much You deserve 
  Though I'm weak and poor all I have is Your's every single breath</lyrics></song>
