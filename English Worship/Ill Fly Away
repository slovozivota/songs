  <lyrics>[V1]
.G                                         C         G
 Some glad morning when this life is o’er, I’ll fly away!
.G                                   G    D    G
 To a home on God’s celestial shore, I’ll fly away.

[C]
.G                        C         G
 I’ll fly away, oh glory, I’ll fly away;
.G                             Em
 When I die, hallelujah by and by,
.G    D    G
 I’ll fly away.

[V2]
.G                                        C         G
 When the shadows of this life have gone, I’ll fly away!
.G                                       G    D    G
 Like a bird from prison bars has flown, I’ll fly away.

[V3]
.G                                    C         G
 Just a few more weary days and then, I’ll fly away!
.G                                     G    D    G
 To a land where joys shall never end, I’ll fly away.</lyrics></song>
