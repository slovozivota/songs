  <lyrics>[V1]
.        D        A         Bm
 As Your children gather in peace
.        G      A          D
 All the angels sing in Heaven;
.        D      A          Bm
 In Your temple all that I seek
.      G            A       D
 Is to glimpse Your holy presence.

[C]
.        G                        D
 All the heavens cannot hold You, Lord,
.         G             A
 How much less dwell in me?
.      G                  Bm
 I can only make my one desire
.G       A       D
 Holding on to Thee.

[V2]
.        D        A          Bm
 All the angels exalt You on high;
.       G       A      D
 What a kingdom to depart!
.        D         A             Bm
 But You left Your throne in the sky
.        G      A          D
 Just to live inside my heart.</lyrics></song>
