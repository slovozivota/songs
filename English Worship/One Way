[V1]
 I lay my life down at Your feet,
 ´Cause You´re the only one I need.
 I turn to You and You were always there.
 In troubled times it´s You I seek,
 I put You first, that´s all I need.
 I humble all I am all to You

[C]
 [:One way, Jesus, You´re the only 
 one that I could live for :] 

[V2]
 You were always, always there,
 Every how and everywhere.
 Your grace abounds so deeply within me.
 You will never ever chance.
 Yesterday today the same
 Forever till forever meets no end.

[V3]
 [: You are the Way the Truth and the Life.
 We live by faith and not by sight for You.
 We´re living all for You. :]</lyrics></song>
