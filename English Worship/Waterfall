  <lyrics>[V1]
 In these last days the rains will come
 Early and late the streams will run
 Down to the sea on to distant shores
 The love of God will flow once more
 
[V2]
 I read it in my father's book
 Now everyday I run, I run to take a look
 Is this the day He'll hear me call?
 And let the rains pour over me
 
[V3]
 Like a waterfall, wash over me
 Above my ankles, rising up past my knees
 From head to toe, I want it all
 Hear my cry o Lord,
 Let the waterfall
 
[V4]
 Water falling with the sound
 Of a thousand angels' wings
 Stirring healing deep within
 With an honest heart
 These songs we'll sing!
