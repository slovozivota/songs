.D G     C2    D  G     C2
 I am so tired of compromising,
.D G     C2    D  G        C2
 I am so tired of lukewarm living;
.D  G      C2 D    G         C2
 So here I am with arms wide open,
.D    G      C2  D  G          C2
 Lord here I am, my heart wide open.

[C]
.D   G     C2
 Set me on fire,
.D   G     C2
 Set me on fire;
.D   G     C2
 Set me on fire,
.D   G     C2
 Set me on fire.

[B]
.Em   D             C2
 Take this heart of mine,
.Em         D      C
 Place Your love inside;
.Em        D              C2
 I want to go against the grain,
.Em        D              C2
 I want to go against the grain.</lyrics></song>
