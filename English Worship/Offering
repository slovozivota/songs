.F#m          E    A       F#m        E            A
 Magnificent, Holy Father, I stand in awe of all I see.
.D          A                  F#m   D                                E
 Of all the things You have created, but still You choose to think of me.

[V2]
.F#m         E                A      F#m       E              A
 And who am I that You should suffer Your very life to set me free?
.D        A                F#m   D      A                E
 The only thing that I can offer is the life You gave to me.

[C]
.           D              A                D                E
 This is my offering, dear Lord. This is my offering to You, God.
.       F#m         E              A             D
 I will give You my life, for it's all I have to give,
.                      E        F#m E A F#m E A
 Because You gave Your life for me.

[V3]
.F#m       E                A      F#m     E              A
 I stand before You at this alter; so many have given You more.
.D         A               F#m    D          A             E
 I may not have much I can offer, yet what I have is truly Yours.</lyrics></song>
