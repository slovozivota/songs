  <lyrics>[V1]
.    D                    A        G
 Who is this King of Glory that pursues me with His love,
.    D                          A       G
 And haunts me with each hearing of His softly spoken words?
.   G                           Bm
 My conscience a reminder of forgiveness that I need,
.    A                     G                 D
 Who is this King of Glory, who offers it to me.

[V2]
.    D                     A    G
 Who is this King of angels, oh blessed Prince of Peace,
.  D                       A    G
 Revealing things of heaven and all it's mysteries?
.   G                             Bm
 My spirit's ever longing for His grace in which to stand,
.    A                     G                      D
 Who is this King of Glory? Son of God and Son of man.

[C]
.            G               Bm
 His name is Jesus, precious Jesus;
.       A               G                 D
 Lord Almighty, King of my heart, King of Glory.

[V3]
.    D                    A     G
 Who is this King of Glory with strength and majesty,
.    D                     A   G
 And wisdom beyond measure, oh gracious King of Kings?
.    G                             Bm
 The Lord of earth and heaven, the Creator of all things,
.   A                    G                   D
 He is the King of Glory, He's everything to me.</lyrics></song>
