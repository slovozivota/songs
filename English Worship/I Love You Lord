  <lyrics>.  G                     D       G
 I love You, Lord, and I lift my voice
.   C  G    Am         D
 To worship You, oh my soul, rejoice!
.     G                D        G
 Take joy, my King, in what You hear,
.            C      G     D             C  G
 May it be a sweet, sweet sound in Your ear.</lyrics></song>
