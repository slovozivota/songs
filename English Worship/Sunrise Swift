[V1]
.f#              E                      A2
   Sunrise       swiftly in my          eyes
   And I         long to greet the      day
   The journey's long and I             don't know what it is I'm searching for
   Where I       find you is where I'll stay

[B]
.C#           D2                 A2
      Hold me close till I can't breath
      Make me stay till I can't  leave
      Take my hand and lead me   on
 My Light, my Way, my            Song

[C]
.                  A2
 Bring back those younger days
.        E              C#
 when a murmur of Your kindness
.          D2
 could be felt beneath my skin
.A2         E              C#
    And the echoes of Your mercy
.      D2
 come welling up within
.A2                        E
   Teach me love, teach me love

 Teach me how to love
.C#         D2
   Like You do
.A2                        E
    Show me where, show me where

 Show me where to walk
.C#            D2
 Only close to You

.A2

[V2]
 It seems I can't escape Your love
 You've gone before and know my way
 You fill the heavens above and the earth below
 You make the night as bright as day</lyrics></song>
