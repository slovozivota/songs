  <lyrics>[V1]
 Give thanks to the Lord
 Our God and King
 His love endures forever
 For He is good He is above all things
 His love endures forever
 Sing praise sing praise
 
[V2]
 With a mighty hand
 And an outstretched arm
 His love endures forever
 For the life thatâ€™s been reborn
 His love endures forever
 Sing praise sing praise
 
[V3]
 Forever God is faithful
 Forever God is strong
 Forever God is with us 
 Forever forever
 
[V4]
 From the rising to the setting sun
 His love endures forever
 By the grace of God we will carry on
 His love endures forever
 Sing praise sing praise
