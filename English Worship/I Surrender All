  <lyrics>[V1]
.D            A            G            A      D
 All to Jesus I surrender, All to Him I freely give;
.D           A                   G               A     D
 I will ever love and trust Him, In His presence daily live.

[C]
.D           A    A           D
 I surrender all, I surrender all;
.D      D/F#    G
 All to Thee my blessed Savior,
.D    A      D
 I surrender all.

[V2]
.D            A            G             A      D
 All to Jesus I surrender, Humbly at His feet I bow;
.D                A      D      G              A       D
 Wordly pleasures all forsaken, Take me Jesus, take me now.

[V3]
.D            A            G               A     D
 All to Jesus I surrender, Make me Savior, wholy Thine;
.D               A            G               A        D
 Let me feel the Holy Spirit, Truly know that Thou art mine.

[V4]
.D            A            G              A       D
 All to Jesus I surrender, Lord, I give myself to Thee;
.D                A               G                A       D
 Fill me with Thy love and power, Let Thy blessing fall on me.</lyrics></song>
