.   G              D
 Oh God You are my God,

 And I will ever praise You. (2x)

.       Em              D
 I will seek You in the morning,
.           Am                    F C
 And I will learn to walk in Your ways;
.    G                   D
 And step by step You'll lead me,

 And I will follow You all of my days.

 And I will follow You all of my days.</lyrics></song>
