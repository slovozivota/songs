  <lyrics>.  F#m A2 E H2
  
[V1]
  When I stray from my destiny,
  You put me back on course,
  My struggle is not to better my life,
  It's uniting with it's source
  I want you to be my passion
  And not myself
  For I have found that seeking you
  Is greater than all wealth
  
[C]
.    F#                A       
  I want you to be my passion
.  E          H
  Deeper than the sea, yeah, yeah
.      F#               A    
  And wider than the heavens
.            E           H
  Like your love is for me
  
[V2]
  The disobedience I have in me
  Has dimmed my life today
  Lord let your light shine through me
  So the darkness will run away
  
[V3]
  I want you to be my passion
  And not myself
  For I would rather die with you
  Than to live in sinner's health</lyrics></song>
