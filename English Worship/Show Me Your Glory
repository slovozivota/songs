  <lyrics>[V1]
.F                        Am              C      G     F
 Caught a glimpse of Your splendor in the corner of my eye,
.                   Am             G    F
 The most beautiful thing I'd ever seen;
.F                      Am          C       G       F
 It was like a flash of lightning reflected off the sky,
.                Am           G    C
 And I know I'll never be the same.

[C]
.C            Am
 Show me Your glory,
.F                                         G    C
 Send down Your presence, I wanna see Your face;
.C            Am
 Show me Your glory,
.F                            F
 Majesty shines about You and I can't go on without You Lord.

[V2]
.F                     Am           C      G       F
 When I climb down the mountain and get on with my life,
.                  Am       G      F
 I won't setle for ordinary things;
.F                    Am           C      G  F
 I'm gonna follow You forever, for all of my days;
.                     Am       G    C
 I won't rest until I see You again.</lyrics></song>
