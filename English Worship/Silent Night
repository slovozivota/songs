.Bb
1Silent night, holy night,
2Silent night, holy night,
3Silent night, holy night,

.F               Bb
1All is calm,    All is bright
2Shepherds quake at the sight,
3Son of God,     love's pure light,

.Eb                  Bb
1Round yon Virgin,   Mother and Child,
2Glories stream from heaven afar,
3Radiant beams from  Thy holy face,

.Eb                  Bb
1Holy Infant so      Tender and mild,
2Heavenly hosts sing Alleleulia,
3With the dawn of re_deeming grace,

.F                     Bb
1Sleep in heavenly     peace,
2Christ the Saviour is born!
3Jesus Lord at thy     birth,

.Bb/F       F           Bb
1Sleep in   heavenly    peace.
2Christ the saviour is  born.
3Jesus      Lord at thy birth.</lyrics></song>
