  <lyrics>[Intro]
.   D          Em
 Oh whoa... Oh whoa... (3x)

[C]
.              D
 Everybody was kung-fu fighting, (Huh!)
.                 Em
 Those kicks were fast as lighting;
.                 D
 In fact it was a little bit frightening, (Yeah, yeah!)
.                     Em
 But they fought with expert timing.

[V1]
.          D                     Em
 They were funky china men, from funky china town,
.          D                          Em
 They were chopping men up, they were chopping men down;
.        D                            Em
 It's an ancient chinese art and everybody knew their part,
.       D                        Em
 From a fainting to a slip and a kicking from the hip.

[V2]
.          D                    Em
 There was funky Billy Chen and little Sammy Chong,
.              D                                 Em
 He said, here comes the big boss! (Where?) lets get it on;
.             D                             Em
 We took them all and made a stand, started swaying with the hands,
.       D                                Em
 Sudden motion made me skip, now weâ€™re into a brand new trick.

[B]
.   D                 Em
 Oh whoa... (Hah!) Oh whoa... (Hah!) (3x)</lyrics></song>
