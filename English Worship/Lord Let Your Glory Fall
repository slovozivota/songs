  <lyrics>[V1]
.D             Dmaj7 G    D/F#               G
 Lord let Your glory fall as on that ancient day,
.Bm         D/F#   G    Em            G     D
 Songs of enduring love and then Your glory came;||
.D        Dmaj7   G   D/F#                   G
 And as a sign to You|that we would love the same,
.Bm              D/F#      G     Em           G     D
 Our hearts will sing that song, God let Your glory come.

[C]
.        D                            G
 You are good, You are good, and Your love endures,
.        D                            G
 You are good, You are good, and Your love endures,
.        Bm            D/F#           G              D
 You are good, You are good, and Your love endures today.

[V2]
.D         Dmaj7 G   D/F#                  G
 Voices in uni___son|giving You thanks and praise,
.Bm            D/F#  G     Em            G     D
 Joined by the instruments and then Your glory came;||
.D             Dmaj7  G     D/F#              G
 Your presence like a cloud|upon that ancient day,
.Bm               D/F# G       Em           G     D
 The priests were over-whelmed because Your glory came.

[V3]
.D      Dmaj7    G    D/F#               G
 A sacrifice was made and then Your fire came,
.Bm          D/F#    G      Em           G          D
 They knelt upon the ground|and with one voice they praised. (2x)</lyrics></song>
