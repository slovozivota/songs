.E A           B
 I  believe in Jesus,
.E            A             B
 I believe He is the Son of God;
.E            A        B
 I believe He died and rose again,
.E            A           B
 I believe He paid for us all.

.A2   B                  E                                 A
 And I believe that He's here now, (echo: I believe You're here,)
.B               E
 Standing in our midst;
.A2       B        E                                  A
 With the power to heal now, (echo: With the power to heal,)
.        B           E
 And the grace to forgive.</lyrics></song>
