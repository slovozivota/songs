  <lyrics>[V1]
 There is a voice that must be heard,
 there is a song that must be sung;
 there is a Name
 that must be lifted high.
 There is a treasure more than gold,
 there is a King upon the throne;
 there is One 
 whose praise will fill the skies.

[C1]
 His name is Jesus,
 Friend of sinners,
 Jesus, Jesus, Friend of mine.

[V2]
 There is a peace that calms our fears,
 there is a love stronger than death,
 there is a hope that goes beyond the grave.
 There is a Friend who won‘t let go,
 there is a heart that beats for you;
 there is one Name 
 by which we are saved.

[T]
 When I was captive to my fears,
 You were the One who came to me, 
 You set me free.
