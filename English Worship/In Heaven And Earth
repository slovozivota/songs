  <lyrics>[V1]
 In heaven and earth
 There is none like Him
 The Lord of lords
 The King of kings
 He came to earth
 To die for us
 God raised him up
 Victorious
 
[V2]
 Praise the Lord
 In all the earth
 Praise the Lord
 
[V3]
 We will worship with one voice
 In our king we will rejoice
 We will make his glory known
 Every nation, tribe and tongue
 They will know what He has done
 When we make his glory known
