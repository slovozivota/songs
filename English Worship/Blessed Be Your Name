  <lyrics>[V1]
 Blessed be your name
 in the land that is plentiful
 Where your streams of abundance flow
 Blessed be your name
 Blessed be your name
 when I’m found in the desert place
 Though I walk through the wilderness
 Blessed be your name
 
[C1]
 Every blessing your pour out
 I’ll turn back to praise
 When the darkness closes in Lord
 Still I will say
 
[C2]
 Blessed be the name of the Lord
 Blessed be your name
 Blessed be the name of the Lord
 Blessed be your glorious name
 
[V2]
 Blessed be your name
 when the sun’s shining down on me
 When the world’s all as it should be
 Blessed be your name
 Blessed be your name
 on the road marked with suffering
 Where there’s pain in the offering
 Blessed be your name
 
[V3]
 You give and take away
 You give and take away
 My heart will choose to say
 Lord blessed be your name</lyrics></song>
