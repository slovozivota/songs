.A2          D2/A           A2          D2/A
1This is the air I breathe; This is the air I breathe:
2You are the air I breathe; You are the air I breathe:
.A2   E/G# F#m      D2        E
1Your holy presence living in me.
2Your holy presence living in me.
.A2         D2/A         A2         D2/A
1This is my daily bread; This is my daily bread:
2You are my daily bread; You are my daily bread:
.A2   E/G# F#m  D2        E
1Your very word spoken to me.
2Your very word spoken to me.

.    A E/G# F#m E               D      F#m E
 And I__________, I'm desperate for You,
.    A E/G# F#m E              D2     F#m E
 And I__________, I'm lost without You.</lyrics></song>
