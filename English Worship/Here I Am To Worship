  <lyrics>[V1]
 Light of the world, You stepped down into darkness
 
[V2]
 Opened my eyes, let me see
 
[V3]
 Beauty that made this heart adore You,
 
[V4]
 Hope of a life spent with You.
 
[C]
 Here I am to worship, here I am to bow down,
 
[C2]
 Here I am to say that You're my God
 
[C3]
 You're altogether lovely, altogether worthy,
 
[C4]
 Altogether wonderful to me.
 
[V5]
 King of all days, oh so highly exalted,
 
[V6]
 Glorious in Heaven above;
 
[V7]
 Humbly You came to the earth You created,
 
[V8]
 All for loveâ€™s sake became poor.
 
[B]
 I'll never know how much it cost
 
[B2]
 To see my sin upon that cross.</lyrics>
