  <lyrics>[V1]
 How easy we forget 
 That cross of shame
 Where one who did no wrong 
 Took all the blame
 Because of love
 
[V2]
 How easy we forget 
 The love you show
 How welcoming you are 
 To everyone
 Who cries to you
 
[C]
 Break our hearts again
 Break our hearts again
 
[V4]
 How weary we become 
 Of doing good
 How deaf and blind we are 
 To those who hurt
 Who cry for help
 
[V5]
 To love as you have loved 
 To be a friend
 To comfort those who mourn 
 And dry their tears
 To hold the broken hearted 
 Share their pain
 
[V6]
 I never will forget 
 That cross of shame
 Where one who did no wrong 
 Took all the blame
 Because of love
