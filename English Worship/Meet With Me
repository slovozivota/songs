  <lyrics>[V]
.A   D       E         A
 I'm here to meet with You,
.A D        E         A
   Come and meet with me;
.A   D       E    A
 I'm here to find You,
.A D        E       A
 Reveal Yourself to me.

[C]
.     A   D    E       A
 As I wait You make me strong,
.     A   D            E       A
 As I long You draw me to Your arms,
.     A    D    E         A
 As I stand and sing Your praise,
.    A         D            E         A
 You come, You come and You fill this place.

[T]
.          A               D        E         A
 Won't You come, won't You come and fill this place.</lyrics></song>
