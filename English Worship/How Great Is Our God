  <lyrics>[V1]
 The splendour of the King, clothed in majesty 
 Let all the earth rejoice 
 All the earth rejoice 
 
[V2]
 He wraps himself in Light, and darkness tries to hide 
 And trembles at His voice 
 Trembles at His voice 
 
[V3]
 How great is our God, sing with me 
 How great is our God, and all will see 
 How great, how great is our God 
 
[V4]
 Age to age He stands 
 And time is in His hands 
 Beginning and the end 
 Beginning and the end 
 
[V5]
 The Godhead Three in One 
 Father Spirit Son 
 The Lion and the Lamb 
 The Lion and the Lamb 
 
[V6]
 Name above all names 
 Worthy of all praise 
 My heart will sing 
 How great is our God
