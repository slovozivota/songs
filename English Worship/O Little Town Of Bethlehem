1O   little town of Bethlehem,
2For Christ is born of Mary,
.    F/C      C        F
1How still we see thee lie;
2And gather'd all a____bove
.              D          Gm
1Above thy     deep and   dreamless sleep,
2While mortals sleep, the angels keep
.      F        C         F
1The   silent   stars go  by.||
2Their watch of wond'ring love.||
.           C7/G         A
1Yet in thy dark streets shineth
2O morning  stars to_____gether
.    Dm             A
1The everlasting    light;
2Pro_claim the holy birth
.    F                  Gm
1And praises sing to    God the King
2The hopes and fears of all the years
.    F        C/F    F
1And peace to men on earth.
2Are met in   thee tonight.</lyrics></song>
