  <lyrics>[V1]
 Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
 The Lord reigns
 Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
 The Lord almighty reigns.

[V2]
 He has shown his awesome power
 He has triumphed mightily
 He's the victor over darkness and the grave
 He has broken chains that bound us
 He has set the prisoner free
 By his own great mercy we are saved.</lyrics></song>
