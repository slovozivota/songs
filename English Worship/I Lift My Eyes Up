[V]
.Bb          Eb         Bb           Eb
1I lift my   eyes up,   up to the    mountains,
2You keep my feet firm, You will not slumber,
.Bb            Eb   Bb   F
1Where does my help come from?
2Oh Lord You   keep me   whole.
.Bb            Eb          Bb        Eb
1My help comes from You,   Maker of  heaven,
2You're at my  right hand, a Shade beside me,
.Bb        Eb Bb  F
1Creator   of the earth.
2Preserver of my  soul.

[C]

 O how I need You, Lord,
.           Eb   Bb
 You are my only hope,

 You're my on_ly prayer;

 So I will wait for You

 To come and rescue me,

 Come and give me life.</lyrics></song>
