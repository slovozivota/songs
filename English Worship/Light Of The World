  <lyrics>[V1]
 Light of the world
 You stepped down into darkness
 Opened my eyes let me see
 Beauty that made this heart adore you
 Hope of a life spent with you
 
[V2]
 Here I am to worship
 Here I am to bow down
 Here I am to say that you’re my God
 You’re altogether lovely
 Altogether worthy
 Altogether wonderful to me
 
[V3]
 King of all days oh so highly exalted
 Glorious in heaven above
 Humbly you came to the earth You created
 All for love’s sake became poor
 
[V4]
 I’ll never know how much it cost
 To see my sin upon that cross
