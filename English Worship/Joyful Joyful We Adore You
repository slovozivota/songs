1In a      manger  lies a   Baby--  Child of Mary,     Son of    God.
2Shepherds kneel before the Infant. Trumpets sound and an__thems raise
.G                D                  G                   D         G
1Voices joined in joyful chorus      Praise You for Your gift of   love.
2As with joy our  hearts are lifted, Joined in wonder,   love, and praise.</lyrics></song>
