  <lyrics>[V1]
.G/B       C      D          G
 Above all powers, above all kings,
.G/B       C          D           G
 Above all nature and all created things;
.          Em         D               C  G/B
 Above all wisdom and all the ways of man,
.C               Am7              D
 You were here before the world began.

[V2]
.G/B       C        D          G
 Above all kingdoms, above all thrones,
.G/B       C           D              G
 Above all wonders the world has ever known;
.          Em         D                C    G/B
 Above all wealth and treasures of the earth,
.C                 Am7                 B7
 There’s no way to measure what You’re worth.

[C]
.G    C     D             G
 Crucified, laid behind a stone,
.    G        C     D           G
 You lived to die rejected and alone;
.       Em   D               C     G/B
 Like a rose trampled on the ground
.             C   Em              C  D
 You took the fall and thought of me
.      G
 Above all.</lyrics></song>
