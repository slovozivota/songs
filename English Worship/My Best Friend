[V1]
 Have you heard of the One called Saviour?
 Have you heard of His perfect love?
 Have you heard of the One in Heaven?
 Have you heard how He gave His Son?
 Well I have found this love and 
 I believe in the Son show me your way

[V2]
 I believe in the one called Saviour
 I believe He's the risen one
 I believe that I'll live forever
 I believe that the King will come
 Because I have found this love and 
 I believe in the Son show me your way

[C]
 [: Jesus you are my best friend 
  and you will always be 
  nothing will ever change that :]
