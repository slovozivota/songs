  <lyrics>[V1]
 When I sing my praise to you
 I am lifted up
 To higher ground
 Something happens in my soul
 When I lift my voice 
 To worship you
 Feels like sunshine on my face
 A cool breeze in a desert place
 
[V2]
 When I worship you
 Heaven comes to me
 Heaven comes to me
 
[V3]
 Heaven is where I belong
 Where the angels sing
 Before your throne
 I am caught up in their sound
 When I lift my voice
 To worship you
 From beyond where eyes can see
 Love is pouring over me
