.D     A/D       G/D             D          G          D/F#     G             Asus   A
 Jesus Christ, I think upon Your sacrifice, You became nothing, poured out to death;
.D    A/D        G/D              D                G           A           D
 Many times I've wondered at Your gift of life and I'm in that place once again;
.G           Asus  A     D
 I'm in that place once again. (2x)

[C]
.    D/F#         G             D/F#            Asus  A
 And once again I look upon the cross where You died,
.    D/F#            G             D2/F2    Asus  A
 I'm humbled by Your mercy and I'm broken inside;
.Bm7          G
 Once again I thank You,
.D/F#         A           G     D
 Once again I pour out my life.

[V2]
.D       A/D   G/D          D              G           D/F#           G            Asus A
 Now You are exalted to the highest place, King of the heavens, where one day I'll bow;
.D       A/D    G/D            D                G           Asus   A     D
 But for now, I marvel at Your saving grace and I'm full of praise once again;
.G           Asus   A     D
 I'm full of praise once again.

[B]
.D                 A      D/F#              G
 Thank You for the cross, thank You for the cross,
.D                 A         D
 Thank You for the cross, my Friend.</lyrics></song>
