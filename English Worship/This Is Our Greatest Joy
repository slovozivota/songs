  <lyrics>[V1]
 This is our greatest joy
 To know that we are Yours
 The Lord Most High
 Maker of the world
 You formed us from the dust
 Our lives will honour You
 Our voices sing
 
[V2]
 Hallelujah, hallelujah
 We cry, hallelujah
 
[V3]
 You left Your Father's home
 Into our world You came
 The innocent who bore
 Our guilt and shame
 When You gave Your life
 The victory was won
 With thankful hearts we sing
 This song of praise
 
[V4]
 Your light of life has come
 Your Spirit makes us strong
 Great hope for all the world
 Through all You've done
 We will worship You
 We will applaud Your ways
 Into Your presence come
 With song of praise.
