  <lyrics>[1]
 I will not
 give up, or shut up,
 or let up, or slow up, 'till I've
 preached up, and prayed up,
 and stored up, and stayed up. (2x)

[2]
 I can never be
 bought,
 comprimised,
 detoured,
 lured away,
 turned back,
 deluded,
 or delayed. (2x)

[C]
 I must go 'till He comes,
 Give 'till I drop,
 Preach 'till all know,
 And work 'till He stops me.
 I have a growing faith that is deep down inside,
 And this is the Spirit in which I abide.</lyrics></song>
