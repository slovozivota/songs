  <lyrics>[C]
 Oh, our Lord and King, our Praise to You we bring;
  There is no other Rock but you.
  Seated high above, You are the One we love.
  This is a song of praise to You.
 
[V1]
  King forever!  You are the first and You're the last.
  You are sovereign, all Your commands will always come to pass
  To give You glory!
 
[V2]
  Who is like You?  Who else is worthy of our praise?
  We exalt You, You reign in majesty and
  Awesome splendour King forever!
 
[V3]
  Abba Father, Your steadfast love will never fail
  You are faithful, You are God and
  I will worship in Your courts forever</lyrics></song>
