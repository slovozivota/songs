  <lyrics>[V1] 
 It's not the end but it feels like it is
 I'm waking up like I'm back from the dead
 I'm stepping out and it feels so free
 But as long as I'm moving it's alright
 
[V2] 
 I feel alive and it hurts for a change
 I'm looking back
 It's hard to believe that I was cool with the days that I wasted
 Complacent and tasteless
 And bored but that was yesterday
 
[C]
 We're never going back to okay
 (Okay)
 We're never going back to easy
 We're never going back to the way it was
 We're never going back to okay
 
[V3] 
 This discontent
 Like a slap in the face
 A mediocre
 I've had enough of this place
 This party's over and I'm moving away from the frills of your Beverly Hills
 That was yesterday
 
[V4]  
 We're here to stay
 This is our time
 My only life
 Our chance to live
