  <lyrics>[V1]
 I'm forgiven, be-cause You were forsak-en
 I'm ac-cepted; You were condemned
 I'm alive and well, Your Spirit is within me
 Because you died and rose again
 
[C] 
 Amazing love, how can it be
 That You my king would die for me?
 Amazing love, I know it's true
 And It's my joy to honor You
 In all I do I honor You
 
[V2]
 You are my king
 You are my king
 Jesus, You are my king
 Jesus, You are my king</lyrics>
