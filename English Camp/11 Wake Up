  <lyrics>[V1a]
 Feels like I'm going through the motions in the dark
 In a world that leaves me with an uninspired heart
 
[V1b] 
 All I know is I'm so tired
 Living life I barely feel
 Give me hope, give me fire
 Give me something real
 
[C1] 
 Cause I don't wanna keep sleepwalkin' through
 Endless days I've had enough of
 Going nowhere, God I want to
 Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!
 
[V2a]
 It's now or never come and pull me from this dream
 Where everything is colorless and nothingâ€™s what it seems
 
[V2b] 
 I believe only You
 Can make me come alive
 Help me be so consumed
 Open up my eyes
 
[C2] 
 Half asleep
 I'm so bored
 Counting sheep
