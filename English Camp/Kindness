  <lyrics>[V1]
 Open up the skies of mercy
 Rain down the cleansing flood
 Healing waters rise around us
 Hear our cries, Lord
 Let 'em rise
 
[C1]
 It's Your kindness, Lord
 That leads us to repentance
 Your favor, Lord
 Is our desire
 
[C2]
 It's Your beauty, Lord
 That makes us stand in silence
 And Your love, Your love is better than life
 
[B]
 We can feel Your mercy falling
 You are turning our hearts back again
 Hear our praises rise to heaven
 
[T]
 Draw us near, Lord
 Meet us here
