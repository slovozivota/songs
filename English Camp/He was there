  <lyrics>[C]
 I will sing to the Lord
 I will sing to the Lord
 He is high above and lifted up
 He is high above and lifted up
 
[V] 
 I will sing to the Lord
 I will sing to the Lord
 He was there for me in the desert
 He was there for me on the mountain top
 He was there for me when there was no water
 He was there for me and He gave me a drink
 
[B] 
 In the desert 
 He was there
 On the mountain 
 He was there
 In the valley deep
 He was there
 Everywhere I look I know my God is there
