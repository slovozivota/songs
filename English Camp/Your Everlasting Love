  <lyrics>[V1]
 Your everlasting love is
 Higher, higher, higher than the sky
 Your everlasting love is
 Higher, higher, higher than the sky            
 Higher then the sky
 
[V2]                                  
 Oh, the wonders of Your everlasting love is              
 Higher than the sky
 
[V3]
 Higher than the heavens above     
 Is the glory of Your wonderful love
 I'm lost in the mystery of Your everlasting love     
 Your everlasting love
 
[V4]
 Your everlasting love is
 Deeper, deper, deeper than the sea
 Your everlasting love is
 Deeper, deper, deeper than the sea
 Deeper than the sea
 
[V5]
 Your everlasting love is
 Reaching, reaching, reaching out to me
 Your everlasting love is
 Reaching, reaching, reaching out to me
 Reaching out to me
