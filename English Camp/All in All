  <lyrics>[V1]
 You are my strength when I am weak
 You are the treasure that I seek
 You are my all in all
 
[V2]
 Seeking you as a precious jewel
 Lord, to give up I'd be a fool
 You are my all in all
 
[C]
 Jesus, Lamb of God, worthy is your name (2Ã—)
 
[V3]
 Taking my sin, my cross, my shame
 Rising again, I bless your name
 You are my all in all
 
[V4]
 When I fall down you pick me up
 When I am dry you fill my cup
 You are my all in all</lyrics>
