  <lyrics>[V1]  
  This world's a tortured place to be,
  So may things to torment me
  And as I stumble down this road, it takes a toll
  These days and nights I turn to you,
  No human hand can pull me through
  No cosmic force or magic brew, will ever do
 
[V2]  
  But I can see it coming, You're not so far away
  'Cause I can feel Your power surging,
  through the whole of me
 
[V3]  
  God is there and He is watching, He tells me all is well
  God is there, there's no denying,
  It's supernatural, Supernatural
 
[V4]  
  Beyond this physical terrain, There's an invisible domain
  Where angels battle over souls in vast array
  But down on earth is where I am, 
  No wings to fly, no place to stand
  Here on my knees I am a stranger in this land
 
[V5]  
  I need an intervention, A touch of providence
  It goes beyond religion, To my very circumstance
[C]  
  God is there and He is watching, He tells me all is well
  God is there, there's no denying, It's supernatural,
  God is there and He is watching, The signs are everywhere
  God is there, there's no denying, it's supernatural,
  Supernatural
  
[V6]
  Six days a universe was made . . . Supernatural
  And from the dead a man was raised . . . Supernatural
  They say He walked across the waves . . . Supernatural
  And I'll believe it to my grave
 
[V7]  
  But I can see it coming, You're not so far away
  'Cause I can feel Your power surging,
  through the whole of me
 
[V8]  
  Some things just can't be explained
