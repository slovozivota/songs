  <lyrics>[V1]
  Yesterday is a wrinkle on your forehead
  Yestarday is a promise that you've broken
  Dont't close eyes, don't close your eyes,
  This is your life.
  And today is all you've got now.
  And today is all you've ever have.
  Don't close your eyes.
  
[V2]
  This is your life, are you who you want to be?
  This is your life, are you who you want to be?
  This is your life, is it everything that you dreamed
  that it would be when the world was younger,
  and you had everything to lose?
  
[V3]
  Yesterday is a kid in the corner
  Yesterday is dead and over.
  
[V4]
  This is your life, are you who you want to be?
  This is your life, are you who you want to be?</lyrics>
