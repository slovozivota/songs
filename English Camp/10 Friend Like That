  <lyrics>[V1] 
 I like it simple and
 I’m not a superman
 I never said that I was more than that
 
[V2] 
 I’m not a wanna be
 I’m who I wanna be
 And I intend to be
 How you created me
 
[V3] 
 I, I need somebody on the inside
 I, I want somebody who can set me free
 I’m not the only one who feels like this
 I’ve got a few others around me
 
[V4] 
 Hey!
 Hey, let me hear you say
 Make some noise if you feel this way
 Hey, if you’ve got a friend like that
 
[V5]
 Hey, let’s scream and shout
 If you know what I’m talkin’ about
 Anybody got a friend like that?
 
[V6]
 I once was little and
 I always had a plan
 You thought my friendliness was just an act
 I’ll be your friend indeed
 And you can count on me
 And I can guarantee
 Your friend I’ll always be
 
[V7]
 I, I need somebody on the inside
 I, I want somebody who can set me free
 I’m not the only one who feels like this
 I’ve got a few others around me
 
[V8]
 Hey!
 Hey, let me hear you say
 Make some noise if you feel this way
 Hey, if you’ve got a friend like that
 
[V9]
 Hey, let’s scream and shout
 If you know what I’m talkin’ about
 Anybody got a friend like that?
 
[V10]
 Does anyone out there feel alone?
 Can anyone hear me? (whoa, whoa)
 Down and out your heart is cold
 It’s never easy (whoa,whoa)
 But if you believe that there is hope
 Then sing it with me
 
[V11]
 Hey, let me hear you say
 Make some noise if you feel this way
 Hey, if you’ve got a friend like that
 
[V12]
 Hey, let’s scream and shout
 If you know what I’m talkin’ about
 Anybody got a friend like that?
 
[V13]
 Hey, let me hear you say
 Does anybody feel this way?
 Hey, if you’ve got a friend like that
 Hey, let’s scream and shout
 If you know what I’m talkin’ about
 Anybody got a friend like that?
 
[V14]
 I, I need somebody on the inside
 I, I want somebody who can set me free
 I’m not the only one who feels like this
 I’ve got a few others around me
 Hey, Hey!
