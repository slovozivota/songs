  <lyrics>[V1]  
  The long awaited rains 
  have fallen hard upon the thirsty ground 
  And carved their way to where 
  the wild and rushing river can be found 
  and like the rains 
  I have been carried here to where the river flows yeah 
 
[V2]  
  My heart is racing and my knees are weak 
  as I walk to the edge 
  I know there is no turning back 
  once my feet have left the ledge 
  and in the rush I hear a voice 
  that's telling me it's time to take the leap of faith 
  So here I go 
  
[C]
  I'm diving in I'm going deep in over my head I want to be 
  caught in the rush lost in the flow in over my head
  I want to go 
  the river's deep the river's wide
  the river's water is alive 
  So sink or swim I'm diving in 
  
[V3]  
  There is a supernatural power 
  in this mighty river's flow 
  it can bring the dead to life 
  and it can fill an empty soul 
  and give a heart the only thing 
  worth living and worth dying for yeah 
 
[V4]  
  But we will never know the awesome power 
  of the grace of god 
  until we let ourselves get swept away 
  into this holy flood 
  So if you'll take my hand 
  we'll close our eyes and count to three 
  and take the leap of faith 
  Come on let's go
