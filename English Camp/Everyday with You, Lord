  <lyrics>[V1]
 Everyday with You, Lord is sweeter than the day before
 Every morning I will worship, every evening I'll adore
 'Cause everyday with You is sweeter, sweeter than the day before
 
[V2]
 What a privilege to know You, like I know You...
 To be loved like You loved me
 What honor to worship, truly worship
 From this heart that You have freed
 From the rising of the sun…to the setting of the same
 
[V3]
 Everyday with You, Lord is sweeter than the day before
 Everyday with You, Lord is Sweeter than the day before
 Every morning I will worship, Every evening I'll adore
 'Cause everyday with You is sweeter, sweeter than the day before
 
[V4]
 What a wonder to live life, really live life.
 Overcoming anything
 What a reason to lift up, freely lift up...
 Everyday my everything
 From the rising of the sun to the setting of the same
 
[V5]
 Everyday with You, Lord is sweeter than the day before
 Everyday with You, Lord is Sweeter than the day before
 Every morning I will worship, Every evening I'll adore
 'Cause everyday with You is sweeter, sweeter than the day before
 
[V6]
 Everyday, everyday with You, Lord 
 Everyday, sweeter than the day before (2×)
 
[V7]
 Everyday with You, Lord is sweeter than the day before
 Everyday with You, Lord is Sweeter than the day before
 Every morning I will worship, Every evening I'll adore
 'Cause everyday with You is sweeter, sweeter than the day before </lyrics></song>
