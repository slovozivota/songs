  <lyrics>[V1]
 I used to think that I was never good enough to cut it
 I bought the lines that were selling time after time
 
[V2]
 But when You opened up my mind and I refused to shut it
 You brought me to a place where I could leave it all behind
 
 
[C]
 Good-bye to my old life
 I don't listen to those lies anymore
 You've given me new life
 Loving you is what I was made for
 
[V3]
 It took a while for me to see but when I finally saw it
 I knew I had to leave my sordid past in the past
 
[V4]
 I couldn't get there on my own it was Your grace that taught it
 My sin is covered by Your blood and I'm not looking back
 
[V5]
 You saw right through me
 Your kindness drew me
 Your mercy knew me
 Your love came to me</lyrics>
