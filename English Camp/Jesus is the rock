  <lyrics>[V1]  
  Jesus is the rock and he rolls my blues away
  (Bop a shoe bob a shoe bop woo!)
  Jesus is the rock and he rolls my blues away
  (Bop a shoe bob a shoe bop woo!)
  Jesus is the rock and he rolls my blues away
  (Bop a shoe bob a shoe bop woo!)
 
[V2]  
  When you're out on the street
  And you really feel down and low
  When you're out on the street
  And there's really no place to go
  When you're out on the street well,
  Jesus gonna save your soul. Cause...
  
[V3]
  When you wake up in the mornin'
  And the sky ain't bright and blue
  When you wake up in the mornin'
  And the big world's after you
  When you wake up in the mornin' well,
  Jesus gonna pull you through. Cause...
