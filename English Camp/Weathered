  <lyrics>[V1]  
  I lie awake on a long, dark night
  I can't seem to tame my mind
  Slings and arrows are killing me inside
  Maybe I can't accept the life that's mine
  No I can't accept the live that's mine
 
[V2]  
  Simple living is my desperate cry
  Been trading love with indifference yeah it suits my just fine
  I try to hold on but I'm calloused to the bone
  Maybe that's why I feel alone
  Maybe that's why I feel so alone
 
[V3]  
  Me...I'm rusted and weathered
  Barely holding together
  I'm coverd with skin that peels and it just won't heal
 
[V4]  
  The sun shines and I can't avoid the light
  I think I'm holding on to life too tight
  Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
  Sometimes I feel like giving up
  Sometimes I feel like giving up
 
[V5]  
  Me...I'm rusted and weathered
  Barely holding together
  I'm coverd with skin that peels and it just won't heal
 
[V6]  
  The day reminds me of you
  The night hides your truth
  The earth is a voice
  Speaking to you
  Take all this pride
  And leave it behind
  Because one day it ends
  One day we die
  Believe what you will
  That is your right
  But I choose to win
  So I choose to fight
  To fight
