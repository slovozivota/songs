  <lyrics>[C]    
  Oh them lions they can eat my body but they can't 
  Swallow my soul no no no 
  They keep on trying to crash my party but they can't
  Get control no no no no
  
[V2]  
  NO   WAY  BA - BY     (GUYS)
  No no     no no no   no no no   (Girls) 
 
[V3] 
  Satan prowls like a roaring lion,
  Seeking whom he will devour.
  Yet I know that though he keeps on trying, 
  He's no match for Jesus' power.
 
[V4]  
  Even demons believe and trem-ble,
  but they try to ruin your life the same.
  Yet I know when the saints assem-ble,
  Satan runs at every sign of Jesus' name, oh baby!
 
[V5]  
  Looking up to heaven in the morning.
  Looking into scriptures at night.
  Somebody is sending me a warning,
  but I'll let Jesus make it right.</lyrics>
