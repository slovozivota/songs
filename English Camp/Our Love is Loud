  <lyrics>[V1]
  When we sing Hear our songs to You 
  When we dance feel us move to You 
  When we laugh Fill our smiles with You 
  When we lift our voices louder still
  Can You hear us? Can You feel?
 
[C]
  We love You Lord, we love You, We love You 
  We love You Lord, we love You, We love You
 
[B]
  And our love is big
  Our love is loud 
  Fill this place with this love now
  Let's lift our voices louder still
  Our God is near Our God is here</lyrics>
