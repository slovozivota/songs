  <lyrics>[V1]
  As I look into the heavens, how foolish I would be
  to deny the king of all this and the crown inside of me
  all the beauty and the splendor, the eternal power of God
  lovingly changing me beyond what i could ever dream of
 
[V2]
  I will worship here before, my king and my God
  seek my own way never more, my king and my God
  live to serve you everyday, my king and my God
  understanding that you do supremely reign
  Lord you do supremely reign</lyrics>
