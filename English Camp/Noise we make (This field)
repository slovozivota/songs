  <lyrics>[V1]
  This is the noise we make
  With our mouth and with our hands
  We've come to celebrate all across this land 
  Yeah, yeah
 
[V2]
  The joy that's in our hearts
  Makes us want to dance for You
  Join as the angels sing
  And worship as they do
 
[C]
  And we worship You alone with
   our songs of praise
  One day before Your throne
   this is the noise we make
 
[C2]
  You are worthy, worthy
  You are holy, holy</lyrics>
