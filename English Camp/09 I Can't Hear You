  <lyrics>[V1]
  This world is making me dizzy
  I can't seem to keep it from spinning
  This life is screaming so loud now
  I can't escape from this crowd now
  |
  It's like I'm climbing up on the shoulders 
  In a room full of strangers
  And then everybody walks away
  
[C1]
  Fly high, jump and touch the sky 
  High, bring me back to life
  I know you're there when I can't hear you
  |
  Down now at the speed of sound now
  When I touch the ground now 
  You'll be there when I can't hear you
  When I can't hear you
 
[V2]  
  I am a classic case of dysfunction
  I talk and talk and still I say nothing
  So tell me, am I the voice of my generation?
  Is everybody having the same conversation?
  |
  We're all climbing up on the shoulders
  In a room full of strangers
  When we should be reaching for you
  
[C2]
  Fly high, jump and touch the sky 
  High, bring me back to life
  I know you're there when I can't hear you
  |
  Down now at the speed of sound now
  When I touch the ground now 
  You'll be there when I can't hear you
  When I can't hear you
  
[B]
  Do you ever get the feeling that you're not alone
  No matter who you are, no matter where you go?
  (3Ã—)
  |
  Feel like you're climbing up on the shoulders
  In a room full of strangers
  We're all reaching
  
[C3] 
  Fly High
  Sky High 
  Life I 
  I can't hear you
  |
  Down now at the speed of sound now
  When I touch the ground now 
  Know you're there when I can't hear you
 
[C4]  
  Fly high
  Jump to touch the sky high
  Bring me back to life
  I know you're there when I can't hear you 
  |
  Down now at the speed of sound now
  When I touch the ground now 
  You'll be there when I can't hear you
  When I can't hear you
  I can't hear you</lyrics>
