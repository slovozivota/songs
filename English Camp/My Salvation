  <lyrics>[V1]  
  My salvation  (My salvation)              
  It's what I'm talking about  (Talking about)               
  With fear it's shakin' shakin' baby now (Shakin' baby)    
  He's gonna work it on out  (Work it on out)
 
[V2]                   
  Yeah He works in you  (Works in you)        
  Yeah He works in me  (Works in me)
 
[V3]          
  To do according to His purpose now  (To His purpose)            
  And set the prisoners free  (Prisoners free)
 
[V4]  
  AAAAAAAAAAA!!!
