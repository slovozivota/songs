  <lyrics>[V1]
 If it wasn't for Your mercy
 If it wasn't for Your love
 If it wasn't for Your kindness
 How could I stand?
 
[V2]
 If it wasn't for Your cleansing
 If it wasn't for Your blood
 If it wasn't for Your goodness
 How could I stand?
 
[V3]
 And yet I find myself again
 Where even angels fear to tread
 Where I would never dare to come
 But for the cleansing of Your blood
 
[V4]
 With You there is forgiveness
 And therefore You are feared
 Jesus, it's Your loving kindness
 That brings me to my knees
 
[V5]
 In the beauty of Your holiness
 In the beauty of Your holiness...
