  <lyrics>[V1]
 You are more beautiful
 Than anyone ever
 Everyday You're the same
 You never change, no never
 
[V2]
 And how could I ever deny
 The love of my Savior
 You are to me everything
 All I need forever
 
[C1] 
 How could You be so good to me?
 
[C2] 
 There is no one like You
 There has never ever been anyone like You
 
[V3] 
 Everywhere You are there
 Earth or air surrounding
 I'm not alone, the heavens sing along
 My God You're so astounding
 How could You be so good to me
 Eternally I believe that'
