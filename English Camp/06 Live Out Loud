  <lyrics>[V1]  
  Imagine this: I get a phone call from Regis,
  He says, "Do you wanna be a millionaire?"
  They put me on the show and I win with two lifelines to spare
  Picture this: I act like nothin' ever happened,
  I bury all the money in a coffee can
 
[V2]     
  Well, I've been given more than Regis ever gave away
  I was a dead man who was called to come out of my grave
  I think it's time for makin' some noise!
  
[V3]
  Wake the neighbors, get the word out, 
  Come on, crank up the music, climb a mountain and shout
  This is life we've been given, made to be lived out
  So la, la, la, la live out loud
  Live out loud, yeah
  
[V4]  
  Think about this: Try to keep a bird from singin',
  After it's soared up in the sky
  Give the sun a cloudless day and tell it not to shine
 
[V5]  
  Think about this: if we really have been given,
  A gift of life that will never end
  And if we have been filled with living hope, we're gonna overflow
  If God's love is burning in our hearts we're gonna glow
  There's just no way to keep it in
    
[V6]
  Wake the neighbors, get the word out, 
  Come on, crank up the music, climb a mountain and shout
  This is life we've been given, made to be lived out
  So la, la, la, la live out loud
  
[V7]  
  Live out loud
  Everybody!    
   la-la-la   la-la-lala la-la-la Live out loud!
  C'mon!    I wanna hear everybody sing!
  
  La-la-la   La-la-lala La-la-la Live out loud!
 
[V8]  
  Every corner of creation, is a living declaration 
  Come join the song we were made to sing
  
[V9]
  Wake the neighbors, get the word out, 
  Come on, crank up the music, climb a mountain and shout
  This is life we've been given, made to be lived out
  So la, la, la, la live out loud
 
[V10]                                              
  [: La-la-la   La-la-lala         La-la-la Live out loud! :]
