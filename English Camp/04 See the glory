  <lyrics>[V1]  
  I never did like the word mediocre
  I never wanted it to be said 
  of me, oh, no
  Just point me to the job and I'd go over, over
  Looking for the very best that could be
  So what is this thing I see
  going on inside of me?
  When it comes to the grace of God
  Sometimes it's like
 
[C]  
  I'm playing Gameboy standing in the middle of the Grand Canyon
  I'm eating candy sittin' 
  at a gourmet feast
  I 'm wading in a puddle when I could be swimming in the ocean
  Tell me what's the deal with me
  Wake up and see the glory
 
[V2]  
  Ever star in the sky tells His story, oh
  And every breeze is singing his song
  All of creation is imploring
  Hey, come see this grand phenomenon
  The wonder of His grace
  should take my breath away
  I miss so many things when I'm consumed with
 
[C]  
  Playing Gameboy standing in the middle of the Grand Canyon
  or eating candy sittin' 
  at a gourmet feast
  or wading in a puddle when 
  I could be swimming in the ocean
  (I know the time has come
   for me to)
  wake up and see the glory
  
[V3]  
  Wake up and see the glory
  Open your eyes and take it in
  Wake up and be amazed
  Over and over again
  Wake up and see the glory
  Open your eyes and take it in
  Wake up and be amazed
  Over and over again</lyrics>
