  <lyrics>[V1]
 My times are in Your hands 
 I know I'll never understand 
 But I'll trust in You 
 Sometimes my heart grows cold 
 I'm sorry when I take control 
 How I'm needing You 
 
[V2]
 Even when I fall 
 You help me stand 
 Even when I'm lost 
 You take my hand 
 
[V3]
 I will hold on 
 I will hold on 
 I will hold on 
 Yes, I will trust in You 
 
[V4]
 My life is in Your hands 
 You hold the key to who I am 
 And I'll trust in You 
 Sometimes my heart is stone 
 I'm sorry when I walk alone 
 How I'm needing You
 
[V5]
 My times are in Your hands 
 I know I'll never understand 
 But I'll trust in You 
 Sometimes my heart grows cold 
 I'm sorry when I take control 
 How I'm needing You 
 
[V6]
 Even when I fall 
 You help me stand 
 Even when I'm lost 
 You take my hand 
 
[V7]
 I will hold on 
 I will hold on 
 I will hold on 
 Yes, I will trust in You 
 
[V8]
 My life is in Your hands 
 You hold the key to who I am 
 And I'll trust in You 
 Sometimes my heart is stone 
 I'm sorry when I walk alone 
 How I'm needing You
