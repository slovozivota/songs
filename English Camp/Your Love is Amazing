  <lyrics>[V1]
 Your love is amazing, steady and unchanging
 Your love is a mountain, firm beneath my feet
 Your love is a mystery, how You gently lift me
 When I am surrounded, Your love carries me
 
[C]
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah
 Hallelujah, Your love makes me sing
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah
 Hallelujah, Your love makes me sing
 
[V2]
 Your love is surprising, I can feel it rising
 All the joy that's growing deep inside of me
 Every time I see You, all Your goodness shines through
 And I can feel this God song, rising up in me
 
[B]
 Yes, You make me sing
 Lord, You make me sing, sing, sing
 How You make me sing
