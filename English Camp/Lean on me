  <lyrics>[V1]  
  Sometimes in our lives, we all have pain
  We all have sorrows, but if we are wise             
  We know that there's always tomorrow
 
[V2]                             
  Lean on me, when you're not strong,
  And I'll be your friend, I'll help you carry on,
  For it won't be long, till I'm gonna need,
  Somebody to lean on.
 
[V3]           
  You just call on your brother, when you need a hand              
  We all need somebody to lean on,   
  I just might have a problem, that you understand     
  We all need somebody to lean on
