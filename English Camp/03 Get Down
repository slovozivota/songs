  <lyrics>[V1]  
  Lavishly our lives are wasted
  Humbleness is left untasted
  You can't live your life to please yourself, yeah
  That's a tip from my mistakes
  Exactly what it doesn't take
  To win you've got to come in last place
  To live your life you've got to lose it
  And all the losers get a crown
  
[C]  
  I get down and He lifts me up
  I get down and He lifts me up
  I get down and He lifts me up
  I get down
  
[V2]  
  All I need's another day
  Where I can't seem to get away
  From the many things that drag me down, yeah
  I'm sure you've had a day like me
  Where nothing seems to set you free
  From the burdens you can't carry all alone
  In your weakness He is stronger
  In Your darkness He shines through
  When you're crying He's your comfort
  When your all alone, He's carrying you
  
[V3]  
  This valley is so deep
  I can barely see the sun
  I cry out for mercy, Lord
  You lift me up again
