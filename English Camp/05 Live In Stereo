  <lyrics>[V1]  
  This field guide's got no soul
  Digging for the sacred
  In a man-made hole
 
[V2]  
  The soil gets harder
  The shovel won't behave
  I just dug myself
  Into a six foot grave
 
[V3]  
  I need a new dimension
  Got to Supersize
  A Jacobean ladder
  To a parallel prize
 
[V4]  
  The walks by faith
  The sight lines lie
  How am I gonna tag along
  With one tin ear
  And one glass eye?
  Well I...
 
[C]  
  I can't get there from here
  When every sense is in mono
  Walk by faith, you appear
  I wanna live in stereo
 
[C]  
  I can't get there from here
  Without a God-directed go
  Walk by faith, you appear
  I've gotta live in stereo
 
[V5]  
  I quit, I fold, I'm done
  Trying to scale Everest
  Sherpa-less 
  Ain't fun
 
[V6]  
  The best-laid plans
  Are in my other pants
  The base camp's buried
  In an avalanche
 
[V7]  
  I need a new dimension
  Got to Supersize 
  A Jacobean ladder
  To a parallel prize
 
[V8]  
  The walk's by faith
  The lone wolf dies
  How am I gonna follow you
  With blue man ears
  And snow blind eyes?
  
[C] 
  I can't get there from here
  When every sense is in mono
  Walk by faith, you appear
  I wanna live in stereo
  I can't get there from here
  Without a God-directed go
  Walk by faith, you appear
  I've gotta live in stereo
