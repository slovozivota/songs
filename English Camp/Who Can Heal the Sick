  <lyrics>[V1]
 Who can heal the sick?
 Who can calm the sea?
 Who has conquered death?
 Who has rescued me?
 
[V2]
 Who can take away my doubt?
 Who can protect me?
 Who can give purpose for my life?
 Who owns my heart?
 
[V3]
 Only Jesus can heal me when I have pain
 Only Jesus can take away my doubts when they come
 Only Jesus, Only Jesus, Son of God
