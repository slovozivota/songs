  <lyrics>[V1]
 We're no longer babies (echo)
 Tossed to and fro (echo)
 Like a ship on the water (echo)
 As the waves hit it so (echo)
 
[B] 
 Rather speaking the truth in love
 We will grow up in Christ
 And we won't be...
 
[C] 
 Tossed to and fro (4Ã—)
 
[V2] 
 We're not changing our minds
 About what we believe
 Just because someone else tells us different
 As they cleverly decieve
 </lyrics></song>
