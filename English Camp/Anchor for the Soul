  <lyrics>[V1]             
 We have this hope - as an anchor for the soul!                                          
 Firm and secure - we have this anchor for the soul! (2x)
  
[V2]
 Now I would walk five hundred miles
 And I would walk five hundred more                                     
 Just to be the one who walks a thousand miles
 To stand firm in my Lord
  
[V3]                 
 Da-da-da-da (4x) da-da-...
  
[V4]        
 And we believe that our God so loved the world                                      
 He gave His Son to be the anchor for our souls (2x)
