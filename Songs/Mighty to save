  <lyrics>[V1]
 Everyone needs compassion,
 love that's never failing
 
[V2]
 Let mercy fall on me,
 Everyone needs forgiveness
 
[V3]
 The kindness of a Saviour;
 the Hope of nations
 
 
[C1]
 
 Saviour, He can move the mountains,
 my God is Mighty to save
 
[C2]
 He is Mighty to save,
 Forever, Author of salvation
 
[C3]
 He rose and conquered the grave,
 Jesus conquered the grave
 
 
[V4]
 So take me as You find me,
 all my fears and failures
[V5]
 Fill my life again,
 I give my life to follow
[V6]
 Everything I believe in,
 now I surrender
 
[V7]
 Shine your light and let the whole world see
[V8]
 we're singing for the glory of the risen King
