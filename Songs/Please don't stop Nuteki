  <lyrics>[V1]
 Please don't stop 
 this words make me higher 
[V2]
 Please don't stop 
 much more then desire 
[V3]
 Please don't stop 
 Please don't stop 
 
[P1]
 If the flood can start 
 with a plain drop 
[P2]
 Sparkling dream ignites 
 with the teardrop 
[P3]
 Please don't stop, 
 please don't stop 
 
[B1]
 If say yes 
 If say so 
[B2]
 You try to be like them all 
[B3]
 Тo matter what happen 
 they make your story short 
[B4]
 Dare to do what 
 I believe thats my flow 
[B5]
 Tries to pu- pu- pu- push
 you back man 
[B6]
 Say I can again and again 
 Do wha- wha- wha- what you feel 
[B7]
 Doing my ways is more even "what do you mean"? 
 
[R1]
 Never dropping fight of emotion 
 Crossing lines without any caution
[R2]
 If I could make outcry 
 Yes you could, please don't lie
[R3]
 Please don't lie 
 Please don't lie 
[B]
 If say yes 
 If say so 
 You try to be like them all 
 Тo matter what happen they make your story short 
 Dare to do what I believe thats my flow 
 Tries to pu- pu- pu- push you back man 
 Say I can again and again 
 Do wha- wha- wha- what you feel 
 Doing my ways is more even "what do you mean"?
 
 If say YES 
 If say NO 
 You try to be like them all
 
 Wasted, standing ready to move on 
 No regrets whatever I have done</lyrics></song>
