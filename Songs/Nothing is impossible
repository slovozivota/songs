  <title>Nothing is impossible</title>
  <lyrics>[C1] 
 Through You I can do anything,
 I can do all things
[C2]
 Cause it's You who gives me strength,
 nothing is impossible
[C3]
 Through You blind eyes are open,
 Strongholds are broken
[C4]
 I am living by faith,
 nothing is impossible

[V1]
 I'm not gonna live by what I see,
 I'm not gonna live by what I feel

[P]
 Deep down I know that You're here with me
 I know that, You can do anything

[B]
 I believe, I believe,
 I believe, I believe in You

[V2]
 Speak to every limitation,
 victory is my declaration

[V3]
 The same power, that raised You from the grave,
 is in me, so I will give you praise
