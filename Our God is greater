  <lyrics>  
[V1]
 Water You turned into wine
 Open the eyes of the blind
 
  
[V2]
 There's no one like You
 None like You
 
  
[V3]
 Into the darkness You shine
 Out of the ashes we rise
 
[V4]
 There's no one like You
 None like You
 
[C1]
 Our God is greater, our God is stronger
 God You are higher than any other
 
[C2]
 Our God is Healer, awesome In power
 Our God, Our God... 
 
 
[C3]
 Into the darkness you shine
 Out of the ashes we rise
 
 
[B1]
 And if Our God is for us, then who could ever stop us
 
   
[B2]
 And if our God is with us, then what can stand against?
 What can stand against?
