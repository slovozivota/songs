  <lyrics>[V1]
  Everyone needs compassion,
 love that's never failing;
 
  
[V2]
 let mercy fall on me.
 
[V3]
  Everyone needs forgiveness,
 the kindness of a Saviour;
 the Hope of nations.
 
[V4]
  Saviour, He can move the mountains,
 my God is Mighty to save,
 He is Mighty to save.
 
[V5]
 Forever, Author of salvation,
 He rose and conquered the grave,
 Jesus conquered the grave.
 
 
[V6]
  So take me as You find me,
 all my fears and failures,
 fill my life again.
 
  
[V7]
  I give my life to follow
 everything I believe in,
 now I surrender.
 
 
  
[V8]
  Shine your light and let the whole world see,
 we're singing for the glory of the risen King.</lyrics></song>
