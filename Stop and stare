  <lyrics>[V1]
 This town is colder now, I think it's sick of us
[V2]
 It's time to make our move, I'm shakin off the rust
[V3]
 I've got my heart set on anywhere but here
[V4
 I'm staring down myself, counting up the years
 Steady hands, just take the wheel...
[V5]
 every glance is killing me
 Time to make one last appeal... for the life I lead
 
[C1]
 Stop and stare
 I think I'm moving but I go nowhere
[C2]
 Yeah I know that everyone gets scared
 But I've become what I can't be, oh
 Stop and stare
[C3]
 You start to wonder why you're 'here' not there
 And you'd give anything to get what's fair
[C4]
 But fair ain't what you really need
 Oh, can you see what I see?
 
[B1]
 They're tryin to come back, all my senses push
 Untie the weight bags, I never thought I could...
[B2]
 Steady feet, don't fail me now
 Gonna run till you can't walk
[B3]
 something pulls my focus out
 And I'm standing down...
 
[P]
 What you need, what you need...</lyrics></song>
