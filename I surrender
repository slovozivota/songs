[V1]
 Here I am
 Down on my knees again
 Surrendering all
 
[V2]
 Find me here
 Lord as You draw me near
 Desperate for You
 
[V3]
 Drench my soul
 As mercy and grace unfold
 I hunger and thirst
 
[v4]
 With arms stretched wide
 I know You hear my cry
 Speak to me now
 
[C]
 I surrender
 I wanna know You more
 
[v5]
 Like a rushing wind
 Jesus breathe within
 Lord have Your way
 Lord have Your way in me
 
[V6]
 Like a mighty storm
 Stir within my soul
 Lord have Your way
 Lord have Your way in me</lyrics></song>
