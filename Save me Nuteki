  <lyrics>[V1]
 So many hearts we
 all used to love 
 But no one burned out 
[V2]
 So many lives in 
 these broken things 
 They found a hideout 
 
[P1]
 Whatâ€™s wrong? 
 Time to step up
[P2]
 and shout now 
 Change the world 
[P3]
 who knows how 
 Does it fit you well 
[P4]
 We all need help 
 to burn it down 
[P5]
 Millions of others who need you
 Thousands of dreams come true
[P6]
 Stand with me and fight 
 Decide what history to write 
 
[R1]
 Save me from myself and change me 
 Look into my eyes and read me 
[R2]
 Bring me on my feet and lead me 
 All I need is to give this all away 
 
[B1]
 Help me to break through 
 Feel it anew 
[B2]
 Make this come true 
 I do, I do this all for you 
 
[V3]
 I tried to shape all this empty ways 
 But all this hurts me 
[V4]
 Then figured out my unsettling thoughts 
 Did we stop feeling? 
 
[B1]
 Help me to break through 
 Feel it anew 
[B2]
 Make this come true 
 I do, I do this all for you </lyrics></song>
